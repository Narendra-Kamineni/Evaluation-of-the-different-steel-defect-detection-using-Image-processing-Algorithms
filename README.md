# Evaluation-of-the-different-steel-defect-detection-using-Image-processing-Algorithms
The aim of this paper is I will be predicting the location and type of defects found in steel manufacturing. Images  are named with a unique Image Id. I must segment and classify the defects in the test set. Each image may have  no defects, a defect of a single class, or defects of multiple classes. For each image. I must segment defects of  each class (Class Id = [1, 2, 3, 4]). The segment for each defect class will be encoded into a single row, even if  there are several non-contiguous defect locations on an image.
